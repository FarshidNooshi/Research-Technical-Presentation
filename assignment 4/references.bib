abstract = {Buildings are slowly replacing long-term investments that consume a lot of energy. Given current economic, as well as environmental constraints on energy resources, the energy issue plays an important role in the design and operation of buildings. Careful long-term decisions in the design and operation of buildings can significantly improve their thermal performance and thus reduce their consumption of energy. Alternative building design strategies, standards compliance and economic optimization can be evaluated using available energy analysis techniques. These range from simplified manual energy analysis methods for approximate energy use estimates to detailed computerized hourly simulation. The availability and ease of use of today’s computers make them effective tools in the decision-making process of building design. This paper reviews the most common building energy analysis techniques and the potential applications of computer technology in the energy simulation and optimization of buildings.}

	abstract = {Energy consumption forecasting for buildings has immense value in energy efficiency and sustainability research. Accurate energy forecasting models have numerous implications in planning and energy optimization of buildings and campuses. For new buildings, where past recorded data is unavailable, computer simulation methods are used for energy analysis and forecasting future scenarios. However, for existing buildings with historically recorded time series energy data, statistical and machine learning techniques have proved to be more accurate and quick. This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing machine learning techniques for forecasting time series energy consumption. Although the emphasis is given to a single time series data analysis, the review is not just limited to it since energy data is often co-analyzed with other time series variables like outdoor weather and indoor environmental conditions. The nine most popular forecasting techniques that are based on the machine learning platform are analyzed. An in-depth review and analysis of the `hybrid model', that combines two or more forecasting techniques is also presented. The various combinations of the hybrid model are found to be the most effective in time series energy forecasting for building.},

abstract = {For the past 50 years, a wide variety of building energy simulation programs have been developed, enhanced and are in use throughout the building energy community. This paper is an overview of a report, which provides up-to-date comparison of the features and capabilities of twenty major building energy simulation programs. The comparison is based on information provided by the program developers in the following categories: general modeling features; zone loads; building envelope and daylighting and solar; infiltration, ventilation and multizone airflow; renewable energy systems; electrical systems and equipment; HVAC systems; HVAC equipment; environmental emissions; economic evaluation; climate data availability, results reporting; validation; and user interface, links to other programs, and availability.}
